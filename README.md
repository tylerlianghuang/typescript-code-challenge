# TypeScript Challenge Instructions

Write a Node project that:
 1. reads in the file `data.json` transforms it into a format that matches `example-output.json`
 2. load transformed data into a datastore - store can be of your choice, in memory or a local database
 3. Create an API that has 2 get API calls. One for customers and one for orders that pull data from the datastore
 4. Create a simple UI that calls the API and displays the customer and the customers orders

## General Approach and Assumptions

- Solution should be implemetned in TypeScript.
- Read JSON `data.json` async from it's directory, convert data async, write into datastore async
- Solution should be run from the command line using `npm run`.
- Solution should be non-blocking.
- Solution should use React or modern equivilent for UI
- Solution APIs should be REST compliant

## Criteria

Your work will be evaluated primarily on:

- Consistency of coding style.
- Correct use of promises, including proper error handling.
- Correct use of TypeScript, including interface/object definitions.
- Absence of "callback hell".
- Correct and complete unit test coverage.
- General quality of code and technical communication.
